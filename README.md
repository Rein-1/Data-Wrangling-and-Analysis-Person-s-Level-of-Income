This comprises data on a person's demographic characteristics, such as age, education, occupation, and income. Understanding the data and spotting any patterns or trends that might be of interest are the goals of this study.


# Analysis


The distribution of capital losses is strongly skewed to the right, which suggests that the majority of people do not experience substantial losses. Since capital gain and income are positively correlated, those with higher earnings typically have bigger capital gains. All backgrounds and genders exhibit the same trend, with married people often earning more money than single ones.
For these analysis, it provides insight into the different elements that affect a person's level of income. We may better understand the income distribution across various groups and the variables that cause income disparity by evaluating the statistics.
